could not figure out why clip area was not working
 	- should be inverse clip area
	. could not figure out why inverse clip area was not working
		- gl_FragCoord has an inverse Y (I still need to adjust the code)


TO DO:
	- clipped areas should be a UI thing
	- ui should have it's own shaders -> seperate t_ui and t_sprite?

	- ! - USE stencil buffer + scissor test for inverse clip area?
	- ! - IMPLEMENT motion blur
